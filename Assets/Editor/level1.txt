# Lines starting with '#' is ignored
# Creates map grid of objects for each character with following meanings:
# W - wall
# E - empty room
# S - main character starting place (with empty room beneath)
# D - debris
# 0 - empty space, outside of 
# spaces - ignored, just for better readability
# More to come, this is just quick proof of concept
